Thank you for participating!
We're not evaluating you in any way, but we're learning from you about how you use the IntellijIDEA and what
works and doesn't work for you. With this, we hope we can make our product better for people like you. There are
no right or wrong answers to any of the questions I'm asking in this study we're simply interested in understanding
how the IntelliJ IDEA interface works to accommodate your needs.

We will conduct this study as a scenario which you will read from the document. You will go through the tasks provided
in the document. While you are working on the tasks, we'd like you to think out loud, which means you give a running
commentary of what's going on in your mind.

You can talk about things you like or don't like. Feel free to say anything that comes to your mind; don't worry about
offending us since we’re here to better understand the usability problems in our software.

We will record a little screencast of you so that we can go back and review things later and make sure we get
everything right. We won't use your name in connection with the recordings or the results. The screencasts  will
only be used internally and never shared anywhere with anyone.

How does all that sound to you? Do you have any questions at this point?
