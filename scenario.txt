1. Start the application which manages bank accounts.

2. In the ClientApplication open accounts search page (“/accounts/search”) to make sure that the application works.
   See that there is only one search available - by account number.

3. Navigate the search controller (WebAccountsController) to get familiar with it. Look at the handler methods and
   corresponding views.

4. We need to add more convenient search - by account owner.

    There is a commented out code both in client and accounts microservices, uncomment it to add the new search.

    4.1 Expose URL for the new search in accounts microservice.
    4.2 Modify handler method in client microservice to accept owner name.
    4.3 Add name input field to the search view.

5. Restart required microservices to see the changes.
6. Make sure that new search appeared in the application view and that it works.
