1. Start the application which manages bank accounts.

2. Open accounts search page (“/accounts/search”) to make sure that the application works.
   See that there is only one search available - by account ID.

3. Navigate the search controller to get familiar with it. Look at the handler methods and corresponding views.

4. We need to add more convenient search - by account owner.
    4.1 Expose URL for the new search in accounts microservice.
    4.2 Modify handler method in client microservice to accept owner name.
    4.3 Add name input field to the search view.

   There is a commented out code both in client and accounts microservices, uncomment it to add the new search.

5. Restart required microservices to see the changes.
6. Make sure that new search appeared in the application view and that it works.
